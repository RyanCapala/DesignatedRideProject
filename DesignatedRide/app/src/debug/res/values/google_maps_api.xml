    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=D3:D6:C4:19:EB:24:9A:4F:EB:7F:F9:F0:BF:9E:40:04:CF:C7:7F:98%3Bcom.example.awesomeness.designatedride.Activities

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    D3:D6:C4:19:EB:24:9A:4F:EB:7F:F9:F0:BF:9E:40:04:CF:C7:7F:98

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    D3:D6:C4:19:EB:24:9A:4F:EB:7F:F9:F0:BF:9E:40:04:CF:C7:7F:98

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.

    Note: This is linked to one of my emails
